# <strong>Conclusion<strong>


---

Our project on the **Teatro Massimo di Palermo** demonstrated the powerful synergy between **semantic web technologies** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in the context of cultural heritage enrichment. 
Starting from a striking data gap in the **ArCo knowledge graph**, we applied a structured methodology to retrieve, validate, and formalize missing cultural, architectural, and historical information about one of Italy‚Äôs most iconic opera houses.

# ‚ö†Ô∏èChallenges 

**üîç SPARQL AND SEMANTIC EXPLORATION**

Exploring the ArCo knowledge graph and comparing it with other cultural sites, such as the Teatro Comunale of Bologna, allowed us to identify specific gaps. 
SPARQL proved to be a powerful but **complex tool**: while initially challenging to grasp, we gradually learned how to formulate precise queries and use them to validate the presence or absence of data.

**üß© RDF TRIPLES**

Generating **RDF triples** also posed difficulties: identifying the correct **predicates** and crafting the right **prompts** required multiple iterations and a deepening understanding of both the ontology and the models. 

**üåê WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT ON GITHUB**

Another major challenge was building our website using **GitHub**. As first-time users, we needed time to understand how the platform works‚Äîhow to organize files, use Markdown, and publish pages. Despite the initial learning curve, we successfully created a **functional** and **well-structured site** to present our work.
