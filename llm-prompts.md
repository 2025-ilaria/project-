# LLM Prompts


---

In this project, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT and Google Gemini, to support the process of enriching the ArCo Knowledge Graph with new cultural heritage data.

üìå **ZERO-SHOT PROMPT TECHNIQUE**

‚Ä¢No examples needed

‚Ä¢Flexible use

‚Ä¢Saves time

‚Ä¢Generalizes knowledge

‚Ä¢Direct interaction

‚Ä¢Quick testing


1Ô∏è‚É£  **Missing information: the full official name**


Using a zero-shot technique, we prompted ChatGPT and Gemini to retrieve information regarding the full official name of the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, without offering any example.

‚úÖ**LLMS comparison**:

Chat GPT gave us a more precise answer, but both provided the information that we were looking for. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Missing information: the architects' names**

Using a zero-shot technique, we prompted ChatGPT to retrieve information about the architects who designed the Teatro Massimo in Palermo.

‚úÖ**LLMS comparison**: 

Both ChatGPT and Gemini provided accurate and reliable information, including the names of the two architects who designed the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, as well as two key dates: the start of construction and the inauguration date.

üìå**FEW-SHOT PROMPT TECHNIQUE**

‚Ä¢ Provides examples ‚Äì Shows the AI a few examples of the desired input-output behavior.

‚Ä¢ Improves accuracy ‚Äì Helps the AI understand the task better than zero-shot prompting.

‚Ä¢ Guides style and format ‚Äì Ensures outputs follow a specific tone or structure.

‚Ä¢ Reduces ambiguity ‚Äì Clarifies what the user expects from the AI.

‚Ä¢ Flexible learning ‚Äì Works even without full model retraining.

‚Ä¢ Good for complex tasks ‚Äì Useful when tasks are too nuanced for zero-shot prompts.


3Ô∏è‚É£ **Missing information: cultural events hosted by Teatro Massimo**

This prompt uses a few-shot technique by providing CHAT GPT and Gemini with examples of other cultural institutions and the types of events they host. By showing these examples, the AI can better understand the expected answer format and the scope of information desired. The prompt clearly asks for a detailed and comprehensive list of events at the Teatro Massimo, including operas, concerts, ballet, and festivals, allowing the model to generate a structured and relevant response.

‚úÖ**LLMS comparison** ‚û°Ô∏è Both provided right answers, but:

-**ChatGPT**: Focuses on specific events and examples, mentioning exact opera productions with dates, notable premieres, and concrete instances of ballet and concerts.


-**Gemini**: Adopts a broader approach, categorizing the theater‚Äôs offerings‚Äîopera, ballet, concerts, educational programs, and festivals‚Äîwithout dates, highlighting repertoire variety, youth initiatives, and special activities like guided tours and immersive productions.


-**ChatGPT**: Emphasizes performing arts activities, including conferences and workshops.


-**Gemini**: Highlights the theater‚Äôs wider cultural role, including fundraising events, tours, and other theatrical productions.



üìå **CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT (CoT) PROMPTING TECHNIQUE**

‚Ä¢ Step-by-step reasoning ‚Äì Encourages the AI to break down problems into intermediate steps before giving a final answer.

‚Ä¢ Improves complex problem solving ‚Äì Useful for math, logic, or multi-step reasoning tasks.

‚Ä¢ Reduces errors ‚Äì Makes the AI less likely to jump to an incorrect conclusion.

‚Ä¢ Transparent thinking ‚Äì Shows the reasoning process, not just the answer.

‚Ä¢ Better accuracy ‚Äì Often leads to more precise and reliable outputs.

‚Ä¢ Supports learning and debugging ‚Äì Helps users understand how the AI reached its conclusion.


4Ô∏è‚É£**Missing information: restoration and intervention**

 It focuses on understanding when and why restorations occurred, the problems or challenges faced during the work, and the results or impact on the theater. The goal is to get a complete picture of the theater‚Äôs restoration history in a logical, chronological order.

‚úÖ**LLMS comparison** ‚û°Ô∏è Cheching on Wikipedia, we noticed that both provided right answers, but:


-**ChatGPT**: Adds an image; presents a chronological and technical structure (it follows the timeline from construction, decline, restoration, to reopening)
emphasizing structural issues, bureaucracy, and modernization. It is more complete and historically constructed compared to Gemini. It follows more faithfully the structure given by the Chain-of-thought prompt. It includes details such as names and specific interventions. 

-**Gemini**: Uses a thematic and narrative structure, organizing information around social, cultural, and political context.
Emphasizes symbolic and civic aspects, like the fight against the Mafia and the city‚Äôs cultural revival.
Does not strictly follow a chronological sequence, prioritizing a storytelling approach with cultural meaning.

-**ChatGPT**: Focuses on architectural and acoustic preservation.


-**Gemini**: Frames the reopening as a civic triumph and connects it to popular culture.


-**Overall**: ChatGPT‚Äôs approach is historical and factual, whereas Gemini‚Äôs is narrative and culturally rich.
