# LLM Prompts

In this project, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT and Google Gemini, to support the process of enriching the ArCo Knowledge Graph with new cultural heritage data.

1Ô∏è‚É£  **Missing information: the full official name**


Using a zero-shot technique, we prompted ChatGPT and Gemini to retrieve information regarding the full official name of the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, without offering any example.

Chat GPT gave us a more precise answer, but both provided the information that we were looking for. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Missing information: the architects' names**

Using a zero-shot technique, we prompted ChatGPT to retrieve information about the architects who designed the Teatro Massimo in Palermo.

Both ChatGPT and Gemini provided accurate and reliable information, including the names of the two architects who designed the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, as well as two key dates: the start of construction and the inauguration date.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Missing information: cultural events hosted by Teatro Massimo**

This prompt uses a few-shot technique by providing CHAT GPT and Gemini with examples of other cultural institutions and the types of events they host. By showing these examples, the AI can better understand the expected answer format and the scope of information desired. The prompt clearly asks for a detailed and comprehensive list of events at the Teatro Massimo, including operas, concerts, ballet, and festivals, allowing the model to generate a structured and relevant response.
