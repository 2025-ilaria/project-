# <strong>Methodology<strong>


This project focuses on the Teatro Massimo Vittorio Emanuele in Palermo, with the main goal of enriching the cultural heritage data available in the ArCo knowledge graph. The methodology combines the structured information already provided by ArCo with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Gemini.

The step-by-step process includes: 

🎯 **Topic Selection**: Defined the focus of the project on Teatro Massimo Vittorio Emanuele in Palermo, with the aim of enriching the ArCo knowledge graph by combining cultural heritage data with LLM-generated knowledge.

🔎 **Exploration of ArCo**: Carried out a systematic exploration of the ArCo knowledge graph to identify what information was already available about Teatro Massimo, and to gain an initial understanding of its data coverage.

📊 **Gap Analysis**: Identified missing data by comparing the ArCo page of Teatro Massimo with that of the Teatro Comunale of Bologna, which provided a more complete knowledge structure.

🤖 **SPARQL Query Generation with LLMs**: Asked ChatGPT and Gemini to generate SPARQL queries targeting ArCo, in order to verify which specific information was already stored in the knowledge graph.

🕵️ **Gap Confirmation**: Validated the gaps by running the generated SPARQL queries and confirming the absence of certain cultural, architectural, and historical details.

💡 **LLM-Assisted Knowledge Retrieval**: Designed targeted prompts (zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought inspired) to gather missing information from ChatGPT and Gemini.

⚖️ **Cross-Model Comparison**: Compared and validated the outputs from both LLMs to ensure reliability and completeness of the new cultural data.

📚 **RDF Triple Generation**: Translated the newly acquired information into RDF triples, strictly aligned with the ArCo ontology.

🌐 **Knowledge Graph Enrichment**: Proposed structured triples in Turtle syntax to extend the ArCo knowledge graph, ensuring semantic coherence and adherence to cultural heritage standards.

🖥️ **Website and Presentation Development**: Built a GitHub-based website and project presentation to document the methodology, results, and the role of LLMs in enriching a cultural heritage knowledge graph.
